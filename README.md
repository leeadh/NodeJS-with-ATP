This is a demo to showcase how to use Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) and connect with Node JS. This is using Node JS to render a simple HTML table and a simple post function which will write and commit to ATP. The templating engine in EJS. 

# Pre-requisites #
1) Log into your assigned ATP VM in the console
2) There would be a folder called node

6) To insert in a record into ATP, go to Postman and execute the post function found in the server.js. A sample post function is here:
localhost:8080/addEmployee. This will default add in an employee into ATP.
